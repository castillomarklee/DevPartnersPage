  My ongoing data security paranoia received a boost of mental adrenaline recently thanks to one of my favorite reads: Wired Magazine. The July issue has a great article, &#8220;Lights Out&#8221;, a story of the ongoing Russian hacking of Ukraine. No one should be surprised by now that the Russians are hacking (at least) the democracies of the world. But the extent of their hacking of Ukraine’s infrastructure is a foreboding look at the near future. Russia has hacked much of the Ukrainian infrastructure, including the power grid and Ministry of Finance. Worse, this could be only a polygon (Russian for &#8220;training ground&#8221;), as there is well-founded fear that a deeper code has been planted for a total country shutdown in the future.

  What does this have to do with Outsourcing? After all, isn’t most outsourced data safe? Yes, it is. But you must be aware and take precautions. Ukraine is a player in the Outsourcing business, especially among engineering tasks. That makes me uncomfortable if I am outsourcing to Ukraine. What about the other global Outsourcing players?

  Keep in mind that security takes many forms: not only protection against hacking but a secure political and cultural environment, language skills, skilled workforce, etc.
</p>
<p>
  India remains the largest outsourcing country but is developing a somewhat unstable political environment. And while it has an educated and skilled workforce, it is one that is often lacking the finer points of business English and even cultural understanding and commonality with Western business.
</p>
<p>
  Malaysia is growing but deeply lacks a good, skilled workforce.
</p>
<p>
  China should be a warning for anyone wanting to keep information secret and secure, for obvious reasons.
</p>
<p>
  The Philippines is a fast growing (46%) outsourcing partner with a highly skilled workforce, low labor costs, English-language proficiency and a Western cultural affinity, reliability and work ethic. Approximately 80% of outsourcing work done in the Philippines is from the US.
</p>
<p>
  The reality is that countries that are politically unstable have higher security risks and risks to infrastructure.
</p>
<p>
  India, Philippines, and South Africa are among longest outsourcing countries with the most political stability.
</p>
<p>
  According to Symantec’s 2017 Internet Security Threat Report, India ranks #5 on the highest number of data breaches in 2016 (the US is #1), no other outsourcing country made the top 10. According to Akamai, India is also #8 on the list of countries with the most hackers (China and US are 1, 2).

  The bottom line for companies, especially Western companies that outsource: data security, political stability, Western business culture and English proficiency are paramount for outsourcing success.
