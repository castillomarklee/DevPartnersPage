  Outsourcing is a $90 billion global market and while we, being tech-centric, think of it as mostly a 21st century endeavor,
  it most certainly is not. Multiple ancient societies outsourced labor to other city-states, American Clipper Ship builders
  of the 18th century outsourced sail-making to the Scotts, the early British textile industry outsourced to workers in India,
  and American toymakers outsourced manufacturing to immediate post WWII Japan.

<p>
  The reasons generations before us outsourced to one degree or another are the same we often do today. The reasons are the
  same, proven business reasons, simple yet solid.
</p>
<h2> Cost Savings </h2>
<p>
  Businesses would not outsource if they did not realize a cost savings. That simple, obvious statement is as true today as
  it was hundreds of years ago. If you can engage a team of software developers in the Philippines at an average cost of
  $20/hour versus a team of comparable developers in San Francisco at $75/hour and the quality of work is within a percentile
  of 5%, the savings, on a short term project or annual basis, are significant. If you are an early or mid-stage startup
  the difference may be the failure or success of your company. If you are an established company, the difference may be
  failing to meet or exceed your quarterly earnings and projected dividends and stock price.
</p>
<h2> Staffing Flexibility </h2>
<p>
  Work needs to be done when it needs to be done, and that is not always a steady constant. Clients donâ€™t always provide a
  steady stream of project work and it does not make sense to keep a constant level of expensive staffing when workflow is
  less than constant. Outsourcing provides a cost effective solution.
</p>
<h2> Speed to Market (or at least project completion) </h2>
<p>
  Whether it is a single, short term project or an ongoing endeavor, engaging an outsourced, trained and experienced team that
  works on a global timeframe, can reduce time to market, time to completion and save money. This of course is dependent
  on providing the outsourced team with complete directions, information and management.
</p>
<h2> Risk Reduction </h2>
<p>
  Hiring expertise in the US is expensive and risky. Hiring contractors only marginally less so in terms of benefits (none
  for contractors), contract obligations, vetting, etc. Hiring an outsourcing team is simply less of a financial and legal
  obligation. Once the project is done, be gone with them! Unhappy with their performance? No need to document a series of
  meetings and performance goals, be gone with them! Now, the reality is that outsourcing companies know this so they want
  to put their best team on your project and keep your business!
</p>
<h2> Your Core Business, Focus On That! </h2>
<p>
  I am a senior business executive. I worked for one of the first Search Marketing companies and know how to run a search campaign.
  But why would I? My core business is creating strategic partnerships with client companies. It makes no sense for me to
  spend my time running a search campaign even though such campaigns are part of the value we bring to clients. That is not
  my core business, it is a tool of that business. Companies focus on their core business and outsource the tools needed
  to those companies whose core business is to provide those tools. Focus on what you do best, what you offer clients, outsource
  the tools (software development, website design?) and spend your resources wisely.
</p>
<p>
  Outsourcing, used appropriately, is leverage in terms of cost savings, opportunity costs and expertise maximized, historically
  speaking.
