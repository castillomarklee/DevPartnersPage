                    is finding the best one in the market. Check out these steps:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <h4>1. Identify your project.</h4>
                        <p> What is the issue? What are the arrangements you have considered? When do you require it done? How
                            much does it cost to offer a solution?</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>2. Compare Freelancers.</h4>
                        <p>If you have finished identifying your project, you may check these sites that will help you connect
                            with the best freelance developers. These top programming remote resources have their own way
                            to evaluate the skills of their web developers.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>1. Dev Partners provides top programmers and designers to global clients. They focus on building
                                a long-term relationship with their clients.</li>

                            <li> 4. Gun.io is a free and open source programming group to businesses. Freelance candidates are
                                screened twice.</li>
                            <li>5. Elance/oDesk/Freelancer.com are great sites to discover freelancers from around the world.</li>
                            <li>6. Local communities this can be an excellent source of help, particularly if you have need for
                                someone to be in your location.</li>
                            <li> 7. Job Listing The third type of site you can use to find freelancers allows you to post job
                                listings. There are hundreds of them, from the well-known ones for career seekers to the
                                niche ones for specific communities.</li>
                        </ul>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>3. Evaluate the Costs Now that you're done comparing the skills of your freelancers.</h4>
                        <p>You are now ready to evaluate the cost. Freelance developer rates generally range from about $10/hour
                            up to $500+/hour. You may hire people overseas and get the same skills. Most clients especially
                            startup companies prefer freelance developers from the Philippines and India, the freelance developers
                            from these countries are skilled and you may hire them at a lower cost.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>4. Understand how Payments Work/How invoices work?</h4>
                        <p>Payment terms can vary wildly based on a number of factors. Most projects will begin with a deposit
                            of 50% of the total. Smaller projects may require full payment up-front. Extremely large projects
                            may require a smaller percentage of the deposit.</p>

                        <p>Also, these days most freelance developers email invoices out now. This means you’ll get them quickly
                            and it will be easier to pay. Each freelancer will have their way of invoicing. Some use FreshBooks,
                            PayPal, and other online invoicing software. These invoices usually have links to process immediate
                            credit card payments.</p>
                    </li>

                    <li>
                        <h4>5. Give Them What They Need.</h4>
                        <p>Unless you’re paying the freelancer to come up with the content too, you’ll need to be sure they
                            get the text, images, videos, and other assets. Remember, that your freelance developer will
                            only help you with what do you want to envision? Imagine a doctor without a stethoscope, of course,
                            the doctor needs one to be able to assess a patient. Your developer is equipped with the skills
                            in building your site, but most of them don't have the capacity to write the content. With this,
                            consider hiring a content writer if you need help with content.</p>

                        <p>You’re now better off than you were before reading this, but the rest is up to you! Your experiences
                            will be unparalleled and will shape the wisdom you take away from the bargaining table and into
                            the next best freelance developer you employ.</p>
